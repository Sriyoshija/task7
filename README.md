*SVM Classification for Breast Cancer Diagnosis*                                                                                                                            

**Overview:**                                                                                                                                                                

This implements Support Vector Machines (SVM) for binary classification of breast cancer diagnoses using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on various features extracted from breast cancer biopsy samples. This includes model training with both linear and RBF kernels, hyperparameter tuning, and visualization of decision boundaries.
